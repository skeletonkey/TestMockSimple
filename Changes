Revision history for Perl extension Test::Mock::Simple.

0.07  Sat Dec  6 20:48:00 2014
	- Added 'allow_new_methods' flag
      This breaks backwards compatibility, however, the arguments for including
      this flag have been persuasive enough for me to break it.
      Hopefully, this only creates a small headache for anyone using Test::Mock::Simple.
